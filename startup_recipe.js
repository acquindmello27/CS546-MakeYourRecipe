	Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 4 minutes. \
	Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes. \
	Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 30-40 minutes. \
	Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet. Arrange chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken starts to blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), about 10 minutes.\
	Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, add to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro sprigs.";

var omletProcedure = "Whisk the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until pale yellow and the egg yolks and whites are evenly combined. Set a serving plate aside. \
Melt the butter in an 8-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat until foaming. Add the egg mixture and stir constantly with a rubber spatula, moving the eggs around the pan until they form small curds, about 2 to 3 minutes. \
Gently shake the pan and use the spatula to spread the egg mixture evenly across the panâ€”the top of the eggs should have a creamy consistency. \
Sprinkle all over with the measured herbs. Remove the pan from heat. Using the spatula, fold a third of the omelet over and onto itself. \
Gently push the folded side of the omelet toward the edge of the pan. Tilt the pan over the serving plate and roll the omelet onto the plate, seam side down. \
Garnish with additional herbs and serve immediately.";

var salmonProcedure = "Cut salmon into 1/4-inch dice, then stir together with spinach, scallions, ginger, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. \
Beat together egg white and soy sauce in a small bowl and stir into salmon mixture, then form into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties. \
Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot and lightly brush with oil. Cook patties, carefully turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes total. \
Serve each burger topped with 1 1/2 teaspoons pickled ginger.";

var burittoProcedure = "In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the onions until softened. Then add the ground beef and cook until the beef is cooked through. Add the cumin, chili powder, oregano and salt and stir to combine. Pour 2 cans of the Mexican tomato sauce into the meat and simmer over low heat for 5 minutes. Add a little water if the mixture gets too dry. \
Meanwhile, heat the refried beans in a saucepan over medium-low heat,add the cheese, and stir it in till it's melted. Remove from the heat.\
Heat the tortillas in the microwave for 1 minute, and then spread a small amount of beans on each tortilla. \
Add a small amount of the meat. Fold over the ends of the tortilla, and then roll them up. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas. Then place them in a large baking dish, cover with foil and keep warm in the oven.\
When ready to serve, drizzle the remaining can of tomato sauce over all of the burritos and sprinkle with more grated Cheddar. Return to the oven for a couple of minutes just to melt the cheese.\
Sprinkle the tops with the cilantro leaves and serve immediately.";

Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth. \
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. \
Brown on both sides and serve hot.";

var vegetableFriedRiceProcedure = "In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.\
Meanwhile, heat peanut oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. \
Add onions, bell pepper, garlic and pepper flakes, to taste. Cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. \
Increase heat to medium-high and stir in cooked rice, green onions and soy sauce. \
Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add peas and cook 1 minute more. Remove from heat.\
